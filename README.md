# Introduction 
Provides a selection of interview problems for interviewers to choose from when doing pairing exercises with interview candidates.

# Getting Started
See ReadMe's in individual repositories for more details.  Generally, you'll want to review the problems available and pick 1 (maybe 2) to work through with a candidate.  Keep in mind that difficulty level varies - try to pick a problem appropriate to the position level (co-op, entry, mid, senior, etc.)

# Contribute
* Unit test projects may give some hints as to implementation and the answer to the problem via TDD, but the project should not explicitly solve the problem in any capacity.  Strive for sensible interfaces, but leave the implementations blank.
